# burger

This project is a "burger logger" that lists the burgers that have been inputted into the database. Each burger has the option to be "devoured". If the user clicks the "devour" button, that burger is moved over to the "devoured" section. 

If the user wants to add a new burger, there is an option to input a new burger into the database. Once submitted, the burger will be added to the list of burgers on the browser. 

This app uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM.
