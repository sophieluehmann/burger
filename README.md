# burger

app not fully functioning yet!!
heres what needs to happen:

- buttons are there, just need to do an onclick function that moves 
the burger over or deletes it from the database
    - this isnt new stuff, just not quite sure where to put it in the code (maybe make another js file under the assets folder like the cat example and include that file in the scripts at the top of main html)

- need to create form and take that input and add it to the mysql database
    - again, not so hard to do..just not totally sure on where to do it or what the exact syntax is 

- once those things are taken care of make sure the code is all working then it will be done!!
